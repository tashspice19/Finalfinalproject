  <br>
  <div class = "padding">
  <p class="tash-text"> Since I was a child, I have always been inspired and have found deep interest in African American history and race relations. During my junior year I wanted to educate myself more on the subject so I began reading texts from “The Color Purple” To  the “New Jim Crow” by Michelle Alexander, constantly updating myself through the news, and seeing speakers like Ta Nehisi Coates talk. My exploration in the subject has broadened my understanding of the corrupt prison and justice system we have; mandatory minimum sentencing and overcharging which incentive plea deals lead to innocent people confessing to crimes they did not commit.The militarization of police and targeting of ethnic minorities have lead to the loss of life and growth of tension. Prisons for profit encourage substandard conditions for inmates and instead of fostering rehabilitation, a cycle of reincarnation continues. I could go on with the list of shocking, gross realities of our justice system in America but what I find to be more informative is the articles and news sites that helped educate me on the subject in the first place. Here are a few interesting updates on the topic and I encourage you to explore the links embedding in each article for further inquiry.

  <p class="tasnuva-text"> We are living in an era of advanced technology, where every part of our daily lives is related to the science of craft in one way or another. The development of technology has led to so many mind-blowing discoveries but at the same has dramatically changed our daily lives. Over the years, technology has revolutionized our world. Technology has created amazing tools and resources, putting useful information at our fingertips. Social media isn’t the only big statement digital technology has made. Neither is social media the only way technology has had an impact in everyone’s life. The future of technology is even more interesting than what is happening right now. In few years, driverless cars may be the norm for everyone and robots will have a common place in factories. As each new technology enters the scene, it has the potential to improve lives.

Knowing information about this breach helped me understand a bit more about apps and websites and what rights we give up when we “accept” the terms and agreements. While it is true we gave them the right to collect our data, there are terms where they don’t specify how much information they collect. By reading more about situations like this we get a better impression on how much power major companies actually have of us.
